Multiple elements of the stack required to manage a python Jupyter Labs environment, they are:

* python
* venv
* virtualenv wrappers
* jupyter-lab/notebook
* ipykernel
* pip

Some notes:

In order to keep thing sane, all python work should always be done in virtual environment.

In general, the easiest way to create, switch, remove virtual environments is with Virtual Environment Wrappers
https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

VirtualEnvironmentWrappers rely on virtualenv https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/

(Note - there is also venv (Python3) and pipenv (which is a combination of requirements and enviroment management) 
venv doesn't do everything that virtualenv can do, and pipenv is a bigger beast)

Pip can be installed with:

o sudo apt update
o sudo apt install python3-pip

Nothing should typically ever be pip installed in the base environment.   Exceptions are typically made for
virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper

A good way of enforcing this is:

o export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true

virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper can be installed with:
o pip3 install virtualenv
o pip3 install virtualenvwrapper

VirtualEnvWrapper can be started with:

	mkdir ~/.virtualenvs

And, in .bashrc: 

	export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
	source {dir_where_virtual_env_wrapper_was_installed}/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Note - that installing virtualenvwrapper with apt-get places virtualenvwrapper in /usr/share
instead of /usr/local/bin.  Typically virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper are installed with pip.
pip3 may also install in /home/{username}/.local/bin.  Example:
    /home/shephard/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

So, in that case, you will need to:
    source /home/shephard/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.shy


One challenge is the infamous:

```/usr/bin/python3.8: Error while finding module specification for 
'virtualenvwrapper.hook_loader' (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'virtualenvwrapper')
virtualenvwrapper.sh: There was a problem running the initialization hooks.

If Python could not import the module virtualenvwrapper.hook_loader,
check that virtualenvwrapper has been installed for
VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.8 and that PATH is
set properly.```

https://medium.com/@gitudaniel/installing-virtualenvwrapper-for-python3-ad3dfea7c717
is a good writeup on that.   You need to ensure that their is a virtualenvwrapper 
installed in the version of python that you used when pip installing it.  Typically
it uses /usr/bin/python3 when you pip3 install, so the the following will work:

```# VirtualEnvWrappers are awesome for python
if [ -f /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh ]; then
  export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
        export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python
  source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
fi```

And everything resolved itself. 

Another Gotcha is bash_completion - 

To install a new version of python, for older versions of ubuntu you will need to add the deadsnakes repo:
https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa


sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3.7
sudo apt-get install python3.8


Once you have your python(s), pip, virtualenv, and virtualenvwrappers installed, you can proceed to create 
a new virtual environment with:
